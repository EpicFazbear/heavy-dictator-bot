# Heavy Dictator Bot
*A Lua-based Discord bot project that has been worked on for a very long time.*
<br>
*It is called "Heavy dictator", a name made up by a friend of mine, and has been turned into an evolved bot with a set of commands and data-saving features over time.*
<br>
*(I don't really know what else to write here, but feel free to use or host this bot as you wish)*

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) in order to run.
- Configurable in the .env file (The template is .env.template)
- Recommended to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host externally 24/7. There's some additional steps you'll need to do in order to set it up, however.

## TODO
- Do some small reformatting
- Create string.split custom function in botinit.lua
- Add file endlines
- Change argument in self.getCoal (botinit.lua) to be a userid instead of a message object
