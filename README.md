# discord-bot-hosting
i don't know how you found this, but yes, this is where Heavy Dictator is being hosted at
(Majorly overhauled to the setup used in my new remote communcations bot)
(Currently going under major new overhauls)

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) in order to run.
- Configurable in the .env file (The template is .env.template)
- Recommended to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host externally 24/7. There's some additional steps you'll need to do in order to set it up, however.

TODO: Write more to this README.md file
